# Miscellaneous Python Scripts

This is a bunch of Python scripts I've made for the Distributed Systems module of [DIT's](http://www.dit.ie) H.Dip. in Computing course. It also includes scripts I've made for [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://www.learnpythonthehardway.org/) by Zed Shaw.

Each project has its own directory, containing supporting files and tests (where tests have been made).

In order to run any of these scripts, you will need to have Python 2.7 installed on your computer. You can then run the relevant script by browsing to the folder it's in and running `python <filename>` (i.e. `python gol.py`) from the /conway/ directory.
